# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created initial framework for Calculator program.

**Thoughts:** Went pretty well. Didn't do too much other than getting inital menu up and running. TODO: add exception handling for if user enters a non integer in main menu prompt.
